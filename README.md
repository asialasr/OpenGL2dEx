# OpenGL2dEx Developer's Guide
*Note: this will be difficult to get running at the moment - LearnOpenGL.com is the best resource while I figure out the best/safest way to add the libraries to the project.  See the "Libraries" section for some more info.*

*Note: a lot of this project is used as a bit of a playground for me to try things out, so at times things might be implemented in a way that allows me to try out new things rather than the safest or best way.  For example, there's a Union class that was fun to work on creating, but in the long-run isn't necessarily a "good" or "safe" class in that I'm not certain how it'll work (or not) with other compilers, etc.*

This project is based on the 2D game example over at [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com).  Originally, I followed through the steps with similar code to what they have available over there, but with my own touches.  Eventually, I wound up refactoring the code and have modified the vast majority of the project.  In addition, I have begun adding my own new features (animations, menus, etc.).  

I've only really tested this on a Windows 10 laptop and a Windows 10 desktop, so I'm not certain how well it behaves on other machines, although it worked nicely when I switched between the two so it should hopefully work on other Windows 10 machines without issue.

## Credits
 * This was originally based off of an example project over at [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com) and was initially created by following the 2D game tutorial over there.  Throughout the tutorial, I took liberties with it and afterwards I have added new features and refactored the majority of the code.  The code at Learn OpenGL is "[licensed under](https://learnopengl.com/About) the terms of the CC BY-NC 4.0 license as published by Creative Commons, either version 4 of the License, or (at your option) any later version."  For simplicity, I am using version 4 of the license.
